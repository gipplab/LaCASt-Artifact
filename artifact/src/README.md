# How to use our program<a name="howTo"></a>
The `bin` directory contains a couple of executable jars. Any of these programs require the `lacast.config.yaml`.
Copy the `config/template-lacast.config.yaml` to the main directory and rename it to `lacast.config.yaml`. Afterward,
update the entries in the template file to the properties that are applicable for you.
LaCASt tries to load the config by following these rules:
1. The system variable `LACAST_CONFIG` specifies the config location, e.g., `export LACAST_CONFIG="path/to/lacast.config.yaml"`.
2. The config file is in the current working directory.
3. Loads the default config from the internal resources in the jar, see [default config](https://github.com/ag-gipp/LaCASt/blob/master/interpreter.common/src/main/resources/lacast.config.yaml) in `interpreter.common/src/main/resources/`

If none of the rules above point to a valid config, LaCASt stops.

<details><summary><code>latex-to-cas-converter.jar</code>: The forward translator (LaTeX -> CAS)</summary>

---
The executable jar for the translator can be found in the `bin` subdirectory. A standalone version can be found in the `bin/*.zip` file. Unzip the archive where you want and run the jar from the root folder of the respository

```shell script
java -jar bin/latex-to-cas-converter.jar
```

Without additional information, the jar runs as an interactive program. You can start the program to directly trigger
the translation process or set further flags (every flag is optional):
* `-CAS=<NameOfCAS>`: Sets the computer algebra system you want to translate to, e.g., `-CAS=Maple` for Maple;
* `-Expression="<exp>"`: Sets the expression you want to translate. Double qutation marks are mandatory;
* `--clean` or `-c`: Only returns the translated expression without any other information. (since v1.0.1)
* `--debug` or `-d`: Returns extra information for debugging, such as computation time and list of elements. (`--clean` overrides this setting).
* `--extra` or `-x`: Shows further information about translation of functions, e.g., branch cuts, DLMF-links and more. (`--clean` flag overrides this setting)

</details>

<details><summary><code>lexicon-creator.jar</code>: Maintain the translation dictionary</summary>

---
Is used to maintain the internal translation dictionaries. Once the translation pattern is defined in the CSV files it must be trasformed to the dictionaries. The typical workflow is:

```shell script
andre@agp:~$ java -jar bin/lexicon-creator.jar 
Welcome, this converter translates given CSV files to lexicon files.
You didn't specified CSV files (do not add DLMFMacro.csv).
Add a new CSV file and hit enter or enter '-end' to stop the adding process.
all
Current list: [CAS_Maple.csv, CAS_Mathematica.csv]
-end
```

<details><summary><code>maple-translator.jar</code>: The backward translator for Maple (Maple -> Semantic LaTeX)</summary>

---
This jar requires an installed Maple license on the machine! To start the translator, 
you have to set the environment variables to properly run Maple (see here [Building and Running a Java OpenMaple Application](https://de.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=OpenMaple%2fJava%2frunning))
In my case, Maple is installed in `/opt/maple2019` and I'm on a Linux machine which requires to set `MAPLE` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
In addition, you have to provide more heap size via `-Xss50M`, otherwise Maple crashes. Here is an example:

```shell script
andre@agp:~$ export MAPLE="/opt/maple2019"
andre@agp:~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/maple2019/bin.X86_64_LINUX"
andre@agp:~$ java -Xss50M -jar bin/maple-translator.jar 
```

To get the Maple paths, you can start maple and enter the following commands:

```
kernelopts( bindir );   <- returns <Maple-BinDir>
kernelopts( mapledir ); <- returns <Maple-Directory>
```

<details><summary><code>symbolic-tester.jar</code>: Symbolic verification program</summary>

---
This is only for advanced users! First, setup the properties:

1) `config/symbolic_tests.properties`
Critical and required settings are:

```properties
# the path to the dataset
dlmf_dataset=/home/andreg-p/Howard/together.txt

# the lines that should be tested in the provided dataset
subset_tests=7209,7483

# the output path
output=/home/andreg-p/Howard/Results/AutoMaple/22-JA-symbolic.txt

# the output path for missing macros
missing_macro_output=/home/andreg-p/Howard/Results/AutoMaple/22-JA-missing.txt
```

2) `symbolic-tester.jar` program arguments:
    * `-maple` to run the tests with Maple
    * `-mathematica` to run the tests with Mathematica (you can only specify one at a time, maple or mathematica)
    * `-Xmx8g` increase the java memory, that's not required but useful
    * `-Xss50M` increase the heap size if you use Maple
    
Additionally, you have to set environment variables if you work with Maple (see the `maple-translator.jar` instructions
above for more details about required variables).

3) Since you may want to run automatically evaluations on subsets, you can use the `scripts/symbolic-evaluator.sh`. Of course you need to update the paths in the script. With `config/together-lines.txt` you can control what subsets the script shall evaluate, e.g.,

```
04-EF: 1465,1994
05-GA: 1994,2179
```

The second argument is excluded (i.e., `1,2` runs only one line, `1` but not `2`).
To test the lines `1465-1994` and `1994-2179` and store the results in `04-EF-symbolic.txgt` and `05-GA-symbolic.txt` file.

</details>

<details><summary><code>numeric-tester.jar</code>: Numeric verification program</summary>

---
This is only for advanced users! First, setup the properties:

1) `config/numerical_tests.properties`
Critical and required settings are:

```properties
# the path to the dataset
dlmf_dataset=/home/andreg-p/Howard/together.txt

# either you define a subset of lines to test or you define the results file of symbolic evaluation, which is recommended
# subset_tests=7209,7483
symbolic_results_data=/home/andreg-p/Howard/Results/AutoMath/11-ST-symbolic.txt

# the output path
output=/home/andreg-p/Howard/Results/MathNumeric/11-ST-numeric.txt
```

2) `numeric-tester.jar` program arguments:
    * `-maple` to run the tests with Maple
    * `-mathematica` to run the tests with Mathematica
    * `-Xmx8g` increase the java memory, that's not required but useful
    * `-Xss50M` increase the heap size if you use Maple

3) Since you may want to run automatically evaluations on subsets, you can use the `scripts/numeric-evaluator.sh`. Of course you need to update the paths in the script. With `config/together-lines.txt` you can control what subsets the script shall evaluate, e.g.,

```
04-EF: 1465,1994
05-GA: 1994,2179
```

This will automatically load the symbolic result files `04-EF-symbolic.txg` and `05-GA-symbolic.txt` and start the evaluation.

### Update Translation Patterns
The translation patterns are defined in `libs/ReferenceData/CSVTables`. If you wish to add translation patterns you need to
compile the changes before the translator can use them. To update the translations, use the `lexicon-creator.jar` (see the explanations above).

### Update Pre-Processing Replacement Rules
The pre-processing replacement rules are defined in `config/replacements.yml` and `config/dlmf-replacements.yml`. Each config
contains further explanations how to add replacement rules. The replacement rules are applied without further compilation.
Just change the files to add, modify, or remove rules.
