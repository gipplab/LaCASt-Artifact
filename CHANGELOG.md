Changelog 29th November 2021, LaCASt Artifact

+ Update the default settings in `config/symbolic_tests.properties` and `config/numerical_tests.properties`
+ Update `README.md`:
    - explain what the lines in the properties file do
    - add a note about a potential `NoSuchFileException`
    - adjust the guide to install the free Wolfram engine since it does not automatically lead to the "developer-lincese" page after creating an account anymore
    - add a new FAQ paragraph that explains what it means when a test "failed" or was "successful"
